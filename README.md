# digital-dealership

## Description

A car rental site that lets you view cars to rent for a specific amount of time, and pay using stripe. You can also list your own car for rent. Youâ€™ll be able to see more information about the car listing when you click on a listing. It was made using mongo, several npm packages including react, and many more things. It was made as a way for people to have access to cars temporaily without having to outright buy one, and to give car enthusists a place to connect.

(Some functionality not implemented)
